Introduction: 

tail2syslog is a perl script that allows you (using globbing patterns) to monitor multiple log 
files and send them out via TCP/UDP syslog via default and/or custom port configuration. 
This can be useful when attempting to incorporate 3rd party data into a SIEM solution for further correlation.
